# Node with React, Mobx minimal boilerplate in My World

I would like to have one single server with nodejs/express 
but reactjs as frontend library. I've modified the other stack and re build in my way

And I find Redux is over complicated with small application like medium size website.
Then Mobx is implemented.

# Installation 
Obviously, I would like to have same port, but i'll imporve it later on.

1. npm install
2. npm run dev // run api server
3. cd app 
4. npm install
5. yarn start (sudo npm install -g yarn)
